# ObjectRecognition

ObjectRecognition use Appleâ€™s iOS 11 CoreML framework to detect and recognise objects realtime as well as in a still image.<br />
I used 2 models for different targets:
* <a href="https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/model-details/ResNet50.txt">ResNet50</a> - For Realtime Recognition
* ![GoogleNet](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/model-details/Places205-GoogLeNet.txt) - For Image Scene Recognition
